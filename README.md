# Shoes AR

A straightforward AR application that locates and recognises a target picture, in this example, a pair of shoes (a van), and then displays a 3D representation of the shoes.

The Vuforia SDK and Unity game engine have been used in its implementation.


Note: The image target used and demo video are already uploaded in the folder.
